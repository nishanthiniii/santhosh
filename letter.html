I don’t know what you’re going through right now, but I want you to know that I’ll always be on your side.  So many things happened between us in such a short period of time...things we couldn’t fully understand or find solutions for. 

I don’t know why we met, but I know this, the very first day I saw you, something felt special to my heart. It was magical ✨💫  I couldn’t even see your face properly that day. All I knew was that you were some random 6-feet guy😅


I loved the way you were reserved, calm, and nonchalant… and how you used to criticize me for being loud and goofy 🙏🏾🤣 I’ll never forget the first time we held hands. That feeling can’t be put into words...thousands of butterflies all at once. 

Being around you always filled me with so much joy🤍✨But it lasted only for a very short time🫠 
Still, at the end of every day, I find myself thinking about you and about how I could fix things. Even now, I’m trying my best not to interrupt your space. Let things be.


I don’t have any anger towards you. You said I behaved like a kid, but to me… you were my kid❤️ 
Santhosh, I honestly don’t know how this will go, but please remember this, I never once thought of abandoning you at any cost🤍✨ 
You’ll always be my precious child.
