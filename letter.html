I don’t know what you’re going through right now, but I want you to know that I’ll always be on your side.
So many things happened between us in such a short period of time… things we couldn’t fully understand or find solutions for.
When we first met, I couldn’t even remember your face — all I knew was that you were some random 6-feet guy 😅.
I loved the way you were reserved, calm, and nonchalant… pidikadhadhum iruku, adhala inge solla mudiyathu 🙏🏾🤣.
I’ll never forget the first time we held hands; that feeling can’t be put into words. Avlo nallarunchu.
Being around you always filled me with so much joy 🤍✨🫠, and I’m trying my best not to interrupt your space. Let things be.
Santhosh, I honestly don’t know how this will go, but please remember this — I never once thought of abandoning you, at any cost 🤍✨.
I wish you more success in the upcoming days.
You’ll always be my precious child.
